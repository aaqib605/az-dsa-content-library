# Implementing a Stack: Arrays vs. Linked Lists

Imagine a stack of heavy cafeteria trays. You can only add a new tray to the **top** of the stack, and you can only take a tray off from the **top**. You can't just magically pull out the third tray from the bottom without causing a massive crash!

This is exactly how a **Stack** data structure operates. It follows the **LIFO** (Last-In, First-Out) principle. The last element you push onto the stack is the very first one you pop off.

While the *concept* of a stack is universal, we can build it under the hood using two different foundational data structures: **Arrays** and **Linked Lists**. Let's dive into both!

---

## 1. Implementing a Stack Using an Array

The easiest way to build a stack is by using a standard Array. We just need to keep track of a `top` variable that points to the index of the highest element.

To implement this, we need:
1. An integer array (`arr`) to store the actual elements.
2. A `capacity` variable to define the absolute maximum size of the stack.
3. A `top` variable to track the current top element. (Initially set to `-1` to indicate the stack is completely empty).

### Core Operations

- **Push (`O(1)`)**: Adds an item. If `top == capacity - 1`, the stack is full (**Stack Overflow**). Otherwise, increment `top` and add the element.
- **Pop (`O(1)`)**: Removes an item. If `top == -1`, the stack is empty (**Stack Underflow**). Otherwise, return the element at `top` and decrement `top`.
- **Peek (`O(1)`)**: Returns the element at `top` without removing it.
- **isEmpty / isFull (`O(1)`)**: Simply checks if `top == -1` or `top == capacity - 1`.

### Code Implementation (Fixed-Size Array)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class ArrayStack {
    int* arr;       // Array to store elements
    int capacity;   // Maximum size
    int top;        // Index of top element

public:
    // Constructor
    ArrayStack(int cap) {
        capacity = cap;
        arr = new int[capacity];
        top = -1;
    }

    void push(int x) {
        if (top == capacity - 1) {
            cout << "Stack Overflow!\n";
            return;
        }
        arr[++top] = x;
    }

    int pop() {
        if (top == -1) {
            cout << "Stack Underflow!\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return arr[top--]; // Return element, then decrement top
    }

    int peek() {
        if (top == -1) {
            cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return arr[top];
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return top == -1;
    }
    
    bool isFull() {
        return top == capacity - 1;
    }
};
```

> 🚨 **The Limitation:** A fixed-size array stack can completely run out of space! If you try to push elements beyond its `capacity`, you hit a `Stack Overflow`. In modern C++, you can seamlessly fix this by using a `std::vector` instead of a raw pointer array, creating a **Dynamic Size Stack** that automatically scales behind the scenes!

---

## 2. Implementing a Stack Using a Linked List

What if you don't know exactly how big your stack needs to be, and you don't want to use an array? You can implement a stack using a **Singly Linked List**!

In this approach, the `head` of the linked list acts as the `top` of the stack. Every time you push an element, you simply insert a new node at the *front* of the list. Every time you pop, you delete the node at the *front*.

### Why use a Linked List?
- **No strict capacity limits**: It grows dynamically as long as your computer has free memory. You never have to worry about a "Stack Overflow" due to an arbitrary fixed capacity limit!
- **Fast operations**: Because we only ever add or remove from the `head` (the top), every operation is strictly `O(1)` time complexity.

### Code Implementation (Linked List)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Defining the Linked List Node
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    Node(int x) {
        data = x;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

class LinkedListStack {
    Node* top;  // Pointer to the top of the stack (the head of the list)
    int count;  // To keep track of the current size
    
public:
    LinkedListStack() {
        top = nullptr;
        count = 0;
    }

    // Push: Insert at the front of the linked list
    void push(int x) {
        Node* temp = new Node(x);
        temp->next = top;
        top = temp;
        count++;
    }

    // Pop: Remove from the front of the linked list
    int pop() {
        if (top == nullptr) {
            cout << "Stack Underflow!\n";
            return -1;
        }
        Node* temp = top;
        top = top->next;
        int val = temp->data;
        
        delete temp; // Free memory!
        count--;
        return val;
    }

    // Peek: Look at the front element
    int peek() {
        if (top == nullptr) {
            cout << "Stack is Empty\n";
            return -1;
        }
        return top->data;
    }

    bool isEmpty() {
        return top == nullptr;
    }

    int size() {
        return count;
    }
};
```

> 💡 **Core Insight:** If you just need a simple, incredibly fast stack and know the maximum size in advance, an **Array Stack** is incredibly CPU cache-friendly and performant. But if your data size is unpredictable and highly volatile, a **Linked List Stack** provides perfect dynamic memory management without any resizing overhead!
