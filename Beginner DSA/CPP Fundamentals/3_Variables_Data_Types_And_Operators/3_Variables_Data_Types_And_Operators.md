# Variables, Data Types, and Operators

Programming is all about taking data, manipulating it, and giving it back. But where does the data live while the program is running? That's where **Variables** come in!

---

## 1. Variables: The Containers of Code

Think of a variable as a labeled box where you can store a piece of information. 

In C++, before you can use a box, you have to do two things:
1. Decide what **type** of data goes inside the box.
2. Give the box a unique **name**.

```cpp
int age;      // 1. Declaration: "I need a box named 'age' that holds an integer."
age = 20;     // 2. Initialization: "Put the number 20 inside the 'age' box."

// You can also do both in one line!
int score = 100;
```

## 2. Essential Data Types

C++ provides different types of boxes depending on what you want to store. Choosing the right data type is crucial in competitive programming to avoid unexpected bugs.

### `int` (Integer)
Used to store whole numbers without decimals.
- **Exact Range:** $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31}-1$
- **CP Perspective:** Roughly $-10^9$ to $10^9$
- **Example:** `int apples = 5;`

> 💡 **Math Trick:** How do we know $-2^{31}$ is roughly $-2 \times 10^9$? In computer science, a handy approximation is $2^{10} \approx 10^3$ ($1024 \approx 1000$). Therefore, $2^{30} = (2^{10})^3 \approx (10^3)^3 = 10^9$. Since it's $2^{31}$, we multiply by 2, getting approximately $2 \times 10^9$!

### `long long` (Large Integer)
When your numbers get too big for an `int`, you use `long long`. This is incredibly common in CP!
- **Exact Range:** $-2^{63}$ to $2^{63}-1$
- **CP Perspective:** Roughly $-10^{18}$ to $10^{18}$
- **Example:** `long long population = 8000000000;`

> 💡 **Pro Tip:** A classic beginner mistake is multiplying two large `int` values and getting a wrong, negative answer (Integer Overflow). If your problem constraints mention $10^5$ and you need to multiply them, the result is $10^{10}$, which exceeds `int`. **Always use `long long` when in doubt!**

### `char` (Character)
Stores a single character, enclosed in single quotes.
- **Example:** `char grade = 'A';`

### `bool` (Boolean)
Stores true or false values (represented as 1 or 0 in memory). Very useful for flags or checking conditions!
- **Example:** `bool isWinner = true;`

### `double` (Decimal)
Stores floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals).
- **Example:** `double pi = 3.14159;`

### `string` (Text)
Stores a sequence of characters, enclosed in double quotes. (Requires the `<string>` library, or simply `<bits/stdc++.h>`).
- **Example:** `string greeting = "Hello AlgoZenith";`

## 3. The `const` Keyword

Sometimes, you have a variable whose value should **never** change. You can lock it by using the `const` keyword. If you accidentally try to change it later, the compiler will save you by throwing an error!

```cpp
const int MOD = 1000000007;
// MOD = 5;  // This would cause a Compilation Error!
```

---

## 4. Operators: Manipulating Data

Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. 

### Arithmetic Operators
Used to perform standard mathematical operations.

| Operator | Name | Example (`a = 10`, `b = 3`) | Result |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `+` | Addition | `a + b` | 13 |
| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b` | 7 |
| `*` | Multiplication | `a * b` | 30 |
| `/` | Division | `a / b` | 3 *(Notice the decimal is dropped!)* |
| `%` | Modulo (Remainder) | `a % b` | 1 |

> ⚠️ **Warning:** In C++, dividing two integers gives an integer. `10 / 3` is `3`, not `3.333`. If you need the exact decimal value, at least one of the numbers must be a `double` (e.g., `10.0 / 3`).

### Comparison Operators
Used to compare two values. They always return a `bool` (`true` or `false`).

- `==` : Equal to (`10 == 10` is true)
- `!=` : Not equal to (`10 != 5` is true)
- `<` : Less than
- `>` : Greater than
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to

### Logical Operators
Used to combine multiple conditions together.

- `&&` (Logical AND): True only if **both** sides are true. (`true && false` is false)
- `||` (Logical OR): True if **at least one** side is true. (`true || false` is true)
- `!` (Logical NOT): Reverses the result. (`!true` is false)

### Assignment Operators
Used to assign values to variables efficiently.

- `=` : Simple assignment (`x = 5`)
- `+=` : Add and assign (`x += 3` is the same as `x = x + 3`)
- `-=` : Subtract and assign (`x -= 3`)
- `*=` : Multiply and assign (`x *= 3`)

### Increment and Decrement
A very fast way to add or subtract 1 from a variable. You'll see these everywhere in loops!

- `++` : Increment by 1 (`x++` is the same as `x += 1`)
- `--` : Decrement by 1 (`x--` is the same as `x -= 1`)
